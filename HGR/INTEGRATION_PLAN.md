# Phase 3: Integration Plan

## Strategy

Instead of trying to create one massive integrated file right away, let's use a **staged approach**:

### Stage 1: Test Component Loading (5 min)
- Create minimal HTML that loads all component files
- Verify they load without errors
- Check browser console

### Stage 2: Test One Component (10 min)
- Start with simplest component (Header)
- Wire it up with minimal props
- Verify it renders

### Stage 3: Add Components Incrementally (30-45 min)
- Add one component at a time
- Test after each addition
- Fix issues as they arise

### Stage 4: Full Integration (15 min)
- All components wired
- Full functionality
- Final testing

## Why This Approach?

- Easier to debug
- Catch errors early
- Build confidence incrementally
- Less overwhelming

## Let's Start with Stage 1!

Create a test file that just loads everything and logs success.
